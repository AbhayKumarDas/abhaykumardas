										<h3>ABHIRAKSHAN (Under Development)
</h3>
										
									</header>
									<p>A system to prevent cyber crime like pishing
by spam/fraud email and website
verification. If any site found malacious on
report then an automated Ddos attack will
be launched on website by bypassing the
cloudflare protection system if implemented.
The system can also make more secure zoom
links by generating new link which will be
accessible to only registered members.

										<h3>ALCOHOL BREATHALYZER CAR
STARTUP SYSTEM</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was a project to prevent road accidents
caused due to drink and driving by using
MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor in the car staring
wheel finds that the driver is drunk or try to
drink then an automation will be triggered
and the drivers needs to blow inside a
alcohol brethalyzer to start the car, checking
weather he is fit to drive or not. If not then
the car will not start, wheels will be locked.

										<h3>ULTRASONIC RAILWAY SAFETY
SYSTEM
</h3>
										
									</header>
									<p>This was the project to prevent rail
accidents. The system could find any
obstacles in the railway track beyond the
visual range of driver and in case 0 visibility
alert the driver before hand about it. Using
AI and with some more fundamentals this
was a step to make driverless trains system.
